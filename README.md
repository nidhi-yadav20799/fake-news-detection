# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project classifies news as **Real** or **Fake** using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.

## Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Text Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Model Training and Evaluation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLP, TF-IDF
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `.ipynb`
2. Run all cells sequentially

## Output
The model predicts whether the given news is real or fake and shows evaluation metrics like accuracy/confusion matrix.
